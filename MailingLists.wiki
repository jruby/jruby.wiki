''Note: JRuby's mailing lists will soon move to our Kenai.com. For now, follow the instructions below. We will announce and auto-migrate everyone to the new lists when the time comes.''

The JRuby community uses several mailing lists to discuss issues, ask for help, and follow JRuby development:

* '''The Users List''' hosts general usage discussions, howtos, and help are discussed here.
* '''The Developers List''' is where folks hacking JRuby and working on deeper integration with other systems can communicate.
* '''The SCM List''' allows anyone to track JRuby commits and JIRA bug tracker updates.
* '''The Issues List''' receives all the new issues created, for lower-traffic tracking of the bug tracker.

To join one or more of the JRuby mailing lists:

# Navigate to http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jruby/lists
# Click the subscribe link for any of the lists (it doesn't matter which) and provide your email
# The xircles application will send you a confirmation email; click the link in the email to return to xircles
# Return to http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jruby/lists and '''now select the subscribe links''' for the list(s) you wish to subscribe

Nabble also has a web archive of both the [http://www.nabble.com/JRuby-f14106.html jruby-dev and jruby-user email lists] and has an excellent interface for searching the lists.

There is a mirror of the jruby-user list at Google: http://groups.google.com/group/jruby-users

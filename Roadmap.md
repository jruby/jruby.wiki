Roadmap
=======

JRuby 1.6 (in maintenance)
--------------------------

With JRuby 1.6 in maintenance mode, we are in "high resistance" for visible changes. In general, only user-reported bugs or egregious problems we discover will go into the jruby-1_6 branch and be released as 1.6.x releases.

JRuby 1.7 (in development)
--------------------------

JRuby 1.7 is the next major version of JRuby. This list includes planned improvements and changes that target the 1.7 release.

* InvokeDynamic support

JRuby 2.0 (future)
------------------

JRuby 2.0 will be the first major release where we have nontrivial breaking changes along with new features. It's our chance to clean things up that have lingered for years.

The following list includes mostly proposed changes that still need to be discussed.

* ClassLoader-global JRuby runtime, to eliminate getRuntime() calls.

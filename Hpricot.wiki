==Installing Hpricot==
The current version of Hpricot (0.7) does not yet work with JRuby. Previous versions (0.6.x) should work with JRuby. As such, to use Hpricot with JRuby 1.2+ you will need to force the appropriate version when installing: 

 jruby -S gem install hpricot --version '~>0.6.1'

You should see something like this

 JRuby limited openssl loaded. gem install jruby-openssl for full support.

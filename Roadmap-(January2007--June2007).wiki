This development outline is based on [http://archive.jruby.codehaus.org/dev/45A29BEE.1060908%40sun.com post] to mailing list.

== February ==
* Official Rails support based on Rails 1.2
* Rails support (via JRuby) in GlassFish or Web 2.0 Pack
* First public release of NetBeans Ruby support? (maybe sooner)
* Big 0.9 release (0.9.8 or similar to convey importance)

== March ==
* Compiler earlies, potential JIT, likely faster than Ruby (the compiler is now consistently faster than Ruby 1.8, but is not yet enabled by default)
* Rounding out features: native Unicode, Java integration (final syntax, 
perf improvements, thinning the proxy boundary) (Much of Java integration syntax is now final; however a large amount of backward-compatible redesign is planned for post 1.0)

== April ==
* Final release before 1.0 (0.9.9, likely)
* Closing out 1.0 features, decide what makes it in
* Major bug-hunting push, 1.0 release branch
* Getting ducks in a row for JavaOne

== May ==
* Release 1.0 beta or RC, announce at JavaOne 2007 (beta or RC was chosen because JavaOne will drive a lot of bug-finders to JRuby; better to call it a beta or RC and release 1.0 final later than to immediately release 1.1 after JavaOne)
* RailsConf 2007, continue the celebration
* Cooling off: let 1.0 sink in, work on transparent improvements 
(compiler, backend; ease back features)

== June, July ==
* JRuby 1.0 final release, after a good several weeks of bake time
* Move toward 1.1, improving Ruby/Java integration and Rubifying more libraries
* Continuing work on the compiler, aiming for JIT enabled in 1.1

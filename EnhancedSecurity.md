$SAFE shows it's age.  It is acknowledged stolen feature from Perl and what does '$SAFE = 3' mean anyways?

Let's give security a facelift.  Let's make a new variable with some builtin feature and extensibility as we realize new aspects of security we want to monitor.

    require 'security'

    $SECURITY[:io] = :warn

This would tell Ruby that the IO subsystem should give warnings on any use of IO but not actually stop working.  Useful for auditing.  If you are on a locked down system:

    $SECURITY[:io] = :error

This will throw a SecurityError on any use of IO.  But let's say you want your own policy:

    $SECURITY[:io] = MyIOPolicy.new

Ok hand-waving is over and obviously this is sparse on details.  Here are the main ideas behind this idea:

1. $SECURITY is multi-dimensional on facilities it can enforce and therefore extensible over time.  :io was given as an example, but any named facility can be provided.  This also is much more intuitive that 1-5.
1. Policy enforcement is a value.  Builtin values can expand over time like :warn and :error, but a user-defined policy can also exist.

A few concerns I have about the proposal:

1. This is prone to the same brittleness where a missing a place where a facility is used is akin to busting a hole in your runtime.  Aint security a bitch.
1. People may not realize that user-defined policy will have some serious consequences on overall performance.

Questions I have:

1. What values should actually be passed into a policy?
1. Should the interface for policies be uniform or match what the policy represents?

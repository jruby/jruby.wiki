<h1>JRuby on Rails</h1>
You can use JRuby with [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on Rails]. JRuby gives Rails the power and functionality of the Java Platform,  providing it with:
* Excellent garbage collection for endless uptimes
* Hotspot profiled dynamic optimizations for great performance
* Access to Java ecosphere for additional technology options
* Deployment to Java application servers for ubiquity

=== Deployment ===

==== War File Deployment ====
If you don't use a traditional Ruby application server like [http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ mongrel], you can use a Java application server.  To deploy to a Java app server, you can use the tool [[Warbler]], a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to create a <tt>.war</tt> file,  to bundle your Rails application in a Java Web Application Archive (<tt>.war</tt> file). Once you have a <tt>.war</tt> file, you can deploy to any Java app server using their war deployment mechanism.

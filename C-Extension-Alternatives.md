JRuby versions prior to 1.6 did not support Ruby C extensions, and even in 1.6 the support is still "in development" and considered experimental. This page lists common C extensions and non-C alternatives you can use to replace them.

* **[RDiscount][]** - Use [Maruku][] (pure Ruby) or [markdown_j][] (wrapper around a Java library)

* **[RMagick][]** - Try [RMagick4J][] (implements ImageMagick functionality in Java) or preferably use alternatives [mini_magick][] & [quick_magick][]. For simple resizing, cropping, greyscaling, etc look at [image_voodoo][].

* **[Unicorn][]** - Try any one of the following [[JRuby-based servers|Servers]]: [Trinidad][], [Mizuno][], [Kirk][] or [TorqueBox][].

* **[Thin][]** - Thin might compile and run but is not recommended. Try any one of the following [[JRuby-based servers|Servers]]: [Trinidad][], [Mizuno][], [Kirk][] or [TorqueBox][].

* **[Typhoeus][]** - The C extension [doesn't currently compile](https://github.com/dbalatero/typhoeus/issues/65). There's no equivalent library for JRuby, but you might try any of the pure-Ruby HTTP clients (`net/http`, httpclient, etc.)

* **mysql** - Use [activerecord-jdbc-adapter][] instead along with `jdbc-mysql`.

* **mysql2** - Use [activerecord-jdbc-adapter][] instead along with `jdbc-mysql`.

* **sqlite3** - Use [activerecord-jdbc-adapter][] instead along with `jdbc-sqlite3`.

* **[Nokogiri][]** - For best results, use the pure-Java version of Nokogiri (1.5 or greater).

* **[yajl-ruby][]** - Try `json` or `json_pure` instead. Unfortunately there is no known equivalent JSON stream parser.

Please add to this list with your findings.

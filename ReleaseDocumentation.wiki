JRuby release preparation

* Make sure a release has no blockers (tests in later steps are good at shagging issues out)
* Try and determine if we break any common extensions (goldspike, ar-jdbc, joni, jsr233 impl, ...)
* Update build-config.xml to reflect new version
* Update the '''version.jruby''' property in '''src/org/jruby/jruby.properties''' to reflect new version
** Example: '''1.1.3RC1"
* Check out svn.codehaus.org/jruby/trunk/updatepoms.rb (curl it)
** run from jruby source tree root with new version (e.g. ../updatepoms.rb 1.1RC3)
* Make tag using svn copy (e.g. svn copy https://svn.codehaus.org/jruby/trunk/jruby https://svn.codehaus.org/jruby/tags/jruby-1_1b2)
* Check out new tag
* Set your java version to Java 1.4 for 1.0 branch and Java 5 for trunk.
* Run 'ant dist' to generate source and binary distribution files, jruby-complete jar, and MD5 files.
* Make 'ant test' runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (Solaris is fine since our CI system is a Solaris boxen) with produced source distribution
* Verify common tasks as extra sanity check (Windows + one other system) [with binary distro -- try some with .zip dist and some with .tar.gz dist]:
** jruby samples/swing2.rb
** jruby -S jirb
** install rails + ar-jdbc
*** setup simple web app and exercise it
*** install and run goldberg (actually any more sophisticated app you know works)
* Upload dist files, jruby-complete.jar, and MD5 files to https://dav.codehaus.org/dist/jruby/{version}
* Replace existing content in https://dav.codehaus.org/dist/jruby/current with the updated release files
* [[Build maven artifacts]]
* Add news item to www.jruby.org page (need to get to confluence editing page for this -- xircles is easy way there if you don't have bookmark)
* Update MainPage on JRuby wiki pointing to new binary
* Update Ruby Application Archive
* Close all resolved bugs associated with the release in JIRA
* Release the version in JIRA
* Send emails to dev@jruby.codehaus.org, user@jruby.codehaus.org, ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org (plus any thing else you may find useful -- internal lists, etc...)
* Update wikipedia entry
* Request MacPorts update
** File a request ticket to update MacPorts at http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets
*** Provide a portfile patch, ideally, similar to http://guide.macports.org/#development.patches.portfile
** Email macports-dev list to ensure the ticket gets noticed: http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-dev/
* Send kmeyer email about Redhat/Fedora packaging
* if new release is final then also update '''version.jruby''' property in '''src/org/jruby/jruby.properties''' in '''trunk''' to reflect new dev version. 
** Example: '''1.1.4-dev'''
* update [[Getting_Started]] to point to the latest release.

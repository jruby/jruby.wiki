=JRuby Nailgun Support=

JRuby 1.3.0+ supports execution with [http://martiansoftware.com/nailgun/index.html Nailgun]. Nailgun allows you to start up a single JVM as a background server process and toss it commands from a fast native client almost eliminating JRuby's annoyingly slow start up time. To use Nailgun with JRuby:

# Download JRuby 1.3.0
# Start the JRuby nailgun server in the background: <code>jruby --ng-server &</code>
# You can now run JRuby commands through that server using the <code>jruby --ng</code> command instead of <code>jruby</code>

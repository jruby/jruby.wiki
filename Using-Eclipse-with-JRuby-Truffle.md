This is an experiment, mainly to have a much feedback from the Truffle annotation processor.  
(and ideally much faster compile time!)

Maven can be used to generate Eclipse project files:
```bash
mvn eclipse:eclipse
```

Then, create a new workspace in Eclipse, outside the jruby directory (otherwise Eclipse complains about overlapping dirs).

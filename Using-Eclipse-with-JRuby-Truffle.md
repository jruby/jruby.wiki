Eclipse is one of the best supported IDE for editing JRuby+Truffle.
It provides excellent feedback from the Truffle DSL annotation processor
and actually keeps the project built at all times by rebuilding it incrementally.

First, make sure the project is already built from the command line:
```bash
$ mx build
```

### Generate the project files

```bash
$ mx eclipseinit
```

### Import the projects

Create a new workspace in Eclipse (>= Luna).

We can now import the projects:
* From the main menu bar, select `File` > `Import...`
* Select `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace`
* Select `jruby` directory as root directory
* Click `Finish`
* *Unselect* `jruby-jars` and `test`.

You shall be set!
There should be now 4 projects in your workspace:
`jruby-truffle`, `jruby-truffle-test`, `RUBY.dist`, `RUBY-TEST.dist`.

### Running from the Eclipse files directly

The [jt workflow tool](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/tree/master/truffle#workflow-tool)
automatically picks up the version compiled by mx and Eclipse oven Maven-compiled files.

```bash
$ tool/jt.rb ruby -e 'p RUBY_ENGINE'
"jruby+truffle"
```

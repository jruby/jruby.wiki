==JRuby With Wrong Java==
[''ed: This page needs revision because some other linux distros have the same problem as Ubuntu.'']

You may find that even though you have an up-to-date JDK installed, JRuby does not work on Ubuntu.  When running <tt>jruby -v</tt>,  you might get exceptions from Java. The reason for these errors might be that, even though you have an up-to-date JDK installed, Ubuntu is not using it by default. You need to update your configuration to use the proper JDK.  See [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java] for more information on this issue.

On Ubuntu 7.10, I ran
 java -version
which said that I was running  Java version 1.5.0 when I knew I had Java version 1.6 installed. I then ran:
 sudo update-alternatives --config java
I picked the option <tt>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java</tt>.  Following that, running <tt>java -version</tt> 
gave me
 java version "1.6.0_03"
 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_03-b05)
 Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.6.0_03-b05, mixed mode)

And JRuby then worked fine.

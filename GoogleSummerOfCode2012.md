Google Summer of Code 2012
=========================

This page hosts the ideas for Google Summer of Code 2012! Add your ideas here, improve others, and if you're a student, perhaps something on this list will interest you!

Here's some classic ideas to get you started:

## Native libraries that need a Java port 

or wrap a Java lib?

## JRuby on Android: Ruboto

Ruboto is working, and has a solid IRB application and tools for generating apps. But there's more we can do, like shrinking the app, improving performance, and building better tooling.

## JRuby for Embedded

There's a few good JVMs that work on embedded devices, which means there's an opportunity for JRuby to expand into embedded applications.

## Kilim integration

Kilim provides a fast coroutine implementation that could be used to provide Fibers or other lightweight tasks inside JRuby. Kilim can now weave bytecode at runtime so integration with a language like JRuby might now be practical.

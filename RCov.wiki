RCov has nascent support for JRuby, but it is not yet in a release. To install it, follow these instructions (at least until there's a -jruby platform gem for rcov proper):

 git clone git://github.com/spicycode/rcov.git
 cd rcov
 jruby -S rake gem
 cd pkg
 jruby -S gem install rcov-0.8.1.3.0-java.gem

### Native coroutine support

Implement some kind of native coroutine support for JRuby. Bonus points for an implementation which is compatible with the Fiber API. One potential approach:

The [Continuations Library](http://www.matthiasmann.de/content/view/24/26/) by Matthias Mann provides the basis for lightweight coroutines on the JVM used by the [Pulsar](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar) and [Quasar](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar) libraries to achieve feats like [10,000 actors on the JVM](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/64210769930/spaceships2).

It would be great if this library could be leveraged from JRuby, either with a proprietary API, or with an implementation of Fibers which is backed by this library.

### Celluloid "Turbo Mode" for JRuby

[Celluloid](http://celluloid.io) is an actor-based concurrent object framework (somewhat similar to Akka) written in pure Ruby. It presently uses Ruby Mutexes and ConditionVariables for synchronization. However, the JVM has many, many other options which could provide better performance. Celluloid provides an [ActorSystem](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/blob/master/lib/celluloid/actor_system.rb) abstraction for supporting multiple different platform-specific backends, and we'd love to have one specific to JRuby.

The goal of this project would be to implement a duck type of the `Celluloid::Mailbox` class that leverages native JVM facilities to improve performance. Some options to consider:

* ***[LMAX Disruptor](http://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/)***: Disruptor is a library which supports a number of different patterns for multithreaded execution. [Some work has already been done to implement Celluloid Mailboxes in terms of Disruptor](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/issues/342)
* ***[ArrayBlockingQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ArrayBlockingQueue.html)***: These are fast, fixed-sized data structures built atop arrays.
* ***[LinkedTransferQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedTransferQueue.html)***: Introduced in Java 7, LinkedTransferQueues are one of the most adaptable concurrency primitives available on the JVM today.

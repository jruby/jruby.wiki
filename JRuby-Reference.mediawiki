; require 'path/to/file.jar'
:require can take a path to a jar file.  It searches the JRuby ''$LOAD_PATH'' for the file.

; require 'java'
: A special `require 'java'` directive in your file will give you access to any bundled Java libraries (classes within your java class path).  However, this will not give you access to any non-bundled libraries.

; #each
: JRuby supports calling the `#each` method on Enumerable objects

; Name translations
:Java: org.foo.department.Widget
Ruby: Java::OrgFooDepartment::Widget

For the top-level Java packages ''java, javax, org, and com'' you can type in a fully qualified class name:

```ruby
java_import java.lang.System
```

You can use your own top-level package names by adding a ''def'':
```ruby
def edu
  Java::Edu
end

java_import edu.example.MyClass
```

; Importing a package into a class or module
: 
```ruby
module M
 include_package "org.xxx.yyy"
 # now any class within "org.xxx.yyy" will be available within
 # this module, ex if "org.xxx.yyy.MyClass" exists
 # a = MyClass.new
end
```
Note that there are issues with include_package, discussed at [[http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-5558]].

; enums
: Available as constants: 
```ruby
ms_constant_value = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit::MILLISECONDS
```

; Alternative Names and Beans Convention

You can use underscore-separated names in addition to camel-cased names.  These two call the same method:

```ruby
  java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis
  java.lang.System.current_time_millis
```

JRuby also translates methods following the 'beans-convention':

```ruby
  x.getSomething            becomes   x.something
  x.setSomething(newValue)  becomes   x.something = new_value
  x.isSomething             becomes   x.something?
```

; Constructors

''JavaClass.new'' or ''JavaClass.new(x,y,z)'' generally work as expected. If you wish to select a particular constructor by signature use reflection:

```ruby
 # Get the the three-integer constructor for this class
 construct = JavaClass.java_class.constructor(Java::int, Java::int, Java::int)
 # Use the constructor
 object = cons.new_instance(0xa4, 0x00, 0x00)
```

A new Implentation to replace Safe/Taint.  Since Safe and Taint do not work and provides a false sense of 
security.  There are two options using a Sandbox type environment or a permission based protocol.  The Sandbox has been around since Java 1.0 and was found to be good only at a macro level.  For finer grain control the Permission class and AccessControl Class was introduced in Java 1.2.  

Having a Permission based security implementation would be ideal.

'''Requirements'''

* it must be something that can be implemented in MRI/KRI, possibly
using the same API/mechanisms used right now.
* it must not introduce overhead back into the system like taint/safe
does now. 
* Security should be based on additon of rights instead of the removal of them.
* Fine Grain control should be allowed for distrubted programming.  for example DRb



'''Possible Solutions'''

* Keep the current Implementation of Safe and Taint
* A sandbox based on the same principles as the Java Sandbox.  
- Here is a sandbox based for MRI[http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/sandbox].
* Use the a Permission based achitecture such as Java 1.2 and later.

JRuby historically has not shipped with a fully functional openssl module due to cryptographic export restrictions. However, in order to support Rails 2.0 out of the box, we implemented a limited subset of openssl that implements <tt>OpenSSL::HMAC</tt> and <tt>OpenSSL::Digest</tt>.

However, this breaks programs that use <tt>require 'openssl'</tt> as a test for whether openssl is available or not. [http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r Soap4r] is one such program. In order to support this behavior, simply add

    require 'jruby/openssl/gem_only'

at the start of your program, and requiring openssl will revert to raising a load error.

See also [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-1808 JRUBY-1808] for a discussion on this feature.
